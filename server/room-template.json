Most of us were randomly assigned to the same dormitory hallway our freshman year, and the group formed out of the simple necessity of finding a place. It really is very lucky. We’ve never been the sort of house which runs on diehard-best-friendship, but we laugh together, and we can’t seem to get into any fights."
